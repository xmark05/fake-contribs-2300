# fake-contribs-2023

This repository generates fake GitHub contributions for a custom word mask in a specified year. It creates empty commits on each day of the target year (except where the mask defines a letter), allowing you to visualize a word (e.g., "LEARNING") as gray squares surrounded by green in your GitHub profile contributions calendar.

## Requirements

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* GitHub repository named `fake-contribs-2023` under your account
* `canvas` npm package

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xmark05/fake-contribs-2023.git
   cd fake-contribs-2023
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install canvas
   ```

## Configuration

Edit `make-heatmap.js` to set your desired year and word:

```js
// In make-heatmap.js
const YEAR = 2023;         // Set the target year (must be in the past)
const WORD = 'LEARNING';   // Set the word to display in the contributions calendar
```

Also verify your GitHub account attribution:

```js
const AUTHOR_NAME  = 'xmark05';
const AUTHOR_EMAIL = 'xmark05@users.noreply.github.com';
```

Ensure `REMOTE` and `BRANCH` match your repository and branch:

```js
const REMOTE = 'https://github.com/xmark05/fake-contribs-2023.git';
const BRANCH = 'main';
```

## Usage

After configuration, run the script to generate and push the commits:

```bash
node make-heatmap.js
```

The script will:

1. Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized).
2. Set up the remote origin.
3. Create empty commits for every day of `YEAR` (skipping days that form your `WORD`).
4. Force-push the commits to `origin/main`.

## Viewing Your Heatmap

1. Open your GitHub profile contributions calendar in a browser:

   ```
   https://github.com/xmark05?tab=contributions&from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31
   ```
2. Alternatively, navigate to your profile and select the year (`2023`) from the contributions calendar dropdown.

You should see your word displayed as gray squares surrounded by green commits.
